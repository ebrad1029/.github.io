          <h2>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</h2>
          With the recent rise in feedback shared on social media platforms,<br>
         companies have been collecting data to get a better understanding<br>
         on how their customers feel towards their company and their <br>products.
         <hr>

          Sentiment Analysis is an automated process where machine learning
          techniques are applied to identify or extract the subjective
          information of a text.<br>It is used to provide companies with
          interesting insights about their customers’ feedback and <br>
          therefore, sentiment analysis is proven essential for any company
          that wants to know how their company is doing.<br>

          <h2>OUR PROJECT</h2>

          In this project, we
          want to grasp the overall perception of State Farm’s customers through
           sentiment analysis among the social media platforms that State Farm
           is associated with.<br>We did this by collecting customers’
          tweets that were posted during critical State Farm events (i.e.
          The Superbowl) <br>and then, with that data, we found out how
          customers’ felt towards State Farm.<br>This data was put into
          graphs created in R and Python and then presented to State Farm in the
          form of a website.
          <hr>
          <br>Our final analysis includes the peaks and valleys
          in sentiment during critical events in the company’s history.<br>
          We created this website to present our findings to State Farm.
          <br>This data will not only help State Farm,
          but it will help their customers as well, as State Farm will be able
          to use these results <br>to help better their customers either through
          providing better options for their products or by providing better
          customer service.
