          With the recent rise in feedback shared on social media platforms,<br>
         companies have been collecting data to get a better understanding<br>
         on how their customers feel towards their company and their <br>products.

          <br>Sentiment Analysis is an automated process where machine learning
          techniques are applied to identify or extract the subjective
          information of a text.<br>It is used to provide companies with
          interesting insights about their customers’ feedback and <br>
          therefore, sentiment analysis is proven essential for any company
          that wants to know how their company is doing.<br>

          In this project, we
          want to grasp the overall perception of State Farm’s customers through
           sentiment analysis among the social media platforms that State Farm
           is associated with.<br>We will do this by collecting customers’
          tweets that were posted during critical State Farm events (i.e.
          The Superbowl) <br>and then, with that data, we will help find how
          customers’ feel towards State Farm.<br>This data will be put into
          graphs created in R and Python and then presented to State Farm in the
          form of a website.



          Our goal for this project is to be able to present to State Farm with
          a sentiment analysis of the general sentiment towards their company
          over time.<br>Our final analysis would include the peaks and valleys
          in sentiment during critical events in the company’s history
          (new commercial, natural disaster, scandals, PR moves, etc.).<br>
          We would present this data to State Farm with various graphs posted
          on a website just for them.<br>  The types of graphs would vary and
          will be based off of different types of data that we gather from
          twitter.<br>State Farm can then use this data to make their company
          the best that it can be.<br>This data will not only help State Farm,
          but it will help their customers as well, as State Farm will be able
          to use these results <br>to help better their customers either through
          providing better options for their products or by providing better
          customer service.
