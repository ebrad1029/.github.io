          With the recent rise in feedback shared on social media platforms, companies have been collecting data <br>
          to get a better understanding on how their customers feel towards their company and their products.<br>
          Sentiment Analysis is an automated process where machine learning techniques are applied to identify or extract the subjective information of a text.<br>
          It is used to provide companies with interesting insights about their customers’ feedback and <br>
          therefore, sentiment analysis is proven essential for any company that wants to know how their company is doing.<br>
          In this project, we want to grasp the overall perception of State Farm’s customers through sentiment analysis among the social media platforms that State Farm is associated with.<br>
          We will do this by collecting customers’ tweets that were posted during critical State Farm events (i.e. The Superbowl) <br>
          and then, with that data, we will help find how customers’ feel towards State Farm.<br>
          This data will be put into graphs created in R and Python and then presented to State Farm in the form of a website.

          Our goal for this project is to be able to present to State Farm with a sentiment analysis of the general sentiment towards their company over time.<br>
          Our final analysis would include the peaks and valleys in sentiment during critical events in the company’s history (new commercial, natural disaster, scandals, PR moves, etc.).<br>
          We would present this data to State Farm with various graphs posted on a website just for them.<br>
          The types of graphs would vary and will be based off of different types of data that we gather from twitter.<br>
          State Farm can then use this data to make their company the best that it can be.<br>
          This data will not only help State Farm, but it will help their customers as well, as State Farm will be able to use these results <br>
          to help better their customers either through providing better options for their products or by providing better customer service.
